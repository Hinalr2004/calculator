It performs fundamental arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator features a user-friendly interface with buttons for digits (0-9), arithmetic operators, a decimal point, an equal sign for evaluating expressions, and a clear button to reset the input field. The design is straightforward, making it suitable for beginners learning Python GUI development.
